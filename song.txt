I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time, daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time, baby
Hot or cold
Don't break me down (don't break me down)
I've been travelin' too long (I've been travelin' too long)
I've been trying too hard (I've been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (with one pretty song)
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride
